 * The 4-condition "no wake path" definition from AGE-924, layered on top of

 * ever cause the issue to be looked at again. An issue can be touched 5
 * minutes ago and still have no wake path (e.g. `in_review` with a cleared
 * monitor); conversely an issue untouched for 100h with a monitor 2 days out
 * is healthy. Only this classifier, not staleHours, should gate an "is this

 * 2. `in_review` + `monitorStatus` in `{none, triggered}` (both `cleared` and

 *    active run, queued run, or scheduled retry (`hasActiveRun`) is bound to
 *    *this* issue — the assignee is saturated on a different lane and cannot
 *    wake this one. A queued wake awaiting a run, or a `scheduled_retry` run,

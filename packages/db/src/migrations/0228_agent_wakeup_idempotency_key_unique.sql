-- Make agent_wakeup_requests.idempotency_key actually deduplicate.
--
-- The column existed but nothing enforced or read it: enqueueWakeup only wrote
-- it, and there was no unique index. Callers that passed a key got a field on
-- the row, not deduplication. Two concurrent enqueues could both miss the
-- other's not-yet-visible wake row and both queue a run with the same key.
--
-- Uniqueness is scoped to (company_id, idempotency_key) and restricted to the
-- statuses in which a wake still represents a run that took effect. Statuses
-- that mean "this wake did NOT happen" (skipped, coalesced, failed, cancelled)
-- stay outside the index on purpose: blocking a later wake because an earlier
-- one was skipped would silently drop work, which is worse than a duplicate
-- run.
--
-- Step 1: resolve any pre-existing duplicates so the index below can be
-- created. Keep one row per (company_id, idempotency_key) -- preferring one
-- that actually carries a run -- and release the key on the rest, recording
-- the released value in `error`.
--
-- Only the key is touched. Status and run linkage are left exactly as they
-- are, because a duplicate wake may still own a live queued run: rewriting its
-- status would either lie about that run or, worse, let the row re-enter the
-- index on its next lifecycle transition (queued -> claimed) and make the
-- claim fail with a unique violation. A row with a NULL key is outside the
-- partial index for good, whatever it does next.
